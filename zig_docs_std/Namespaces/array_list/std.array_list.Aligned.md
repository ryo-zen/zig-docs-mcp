# std.array_list.Aligned

A contiguous, growable list of arbitrarily aligned items in memory. This is a wrapper around an array of T values aligned to `alignment`-byte addresses. If the specified alignment is `null`, then `@alignOf(T)` is used.

Functions that potentially allocate memory accept an `Allocator` parameter. Initialize directly or with `initCapacity`, and deinitialize with `deinit` or use `toOwnedSlice`.

Default initialization of this struct is deprecated; use `.empty` instead.

## Parameters

    T: type

    alignment: ?mem.Alignment

### Fields

    items: Slice = &[_]T{}

Contents of the list. This field is intended to be accessed directly.

Pointers to elements in this slice are invalidated by various functions of this ArrayList in accordance with the respective documentation. In all cases, "invalidated" means that the memory has been passed to an allocator's resize or free function.

    capacity: usize = 0

How many T values this list can hold without allocating additional memory.

## Types

- SentinelSlice
- Slice

|       |        |                                      |
|-------|--------|--------------------------------------|
| empty | `Self` | An ArrayList containing no elements. |

Resize the array, adding `n` new elements, which have `undefined` values. The return value is an array pointing to the newly allocated elements. The returned pointer becomes invalid when the list is resized.

`pub fn addManyAsSlice(self: *Self, gpa: Allocator, n: usize) Allocator.Error![]T`  
Resize the array, adding `n` new elements, which have `undefined` values. The return value is a slice pointing to the newly allocated elements. The returned pointer becomes invalid when the list is resized. Resizes list if `self.capacity` is not large enough.

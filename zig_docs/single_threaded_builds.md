# Single Threaded Builds

Zig has a compile option -fsingle-threaded which has the following effects:

- All [Thread Local Variables](#Thread-Local-Variables) are treated as regular [Container Level Variables](#Container-Level-Variables).

- The overhead of [Async Functions](#Async-Functions) becomes equivalent to function call overhead.
  The `@import("builtin").single_threaded` becomes `true`
    and therefore various userland APIs which read this variable become more efficient.
    For example `std.Mutex` becomes
    an empty data structure and all of its functions become no-ops.

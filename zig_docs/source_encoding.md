# Source Encoding

Zig source code is encoded in UTF-8. An invalid UTF-8 byte sequence results in a compile error.

      

Throughout all zig source code (including in comments), some code points are never allowed:

      
        Ascii control characters, except for U+000a (LF), U+000d 
(CR), and U+0009 (HT): U+0000 - U+0008, U+000b - U+000c, U+000e - 
U+0001f, U+007f.
        
- Non-Ascii Unicode line endings: U+0085 (NEL), U+2028 (LS), U+2029 (PS).
      
      

      LF (byte value 0x0a, code point U+000a, `'\n'`) is the line terminator in Zig source code.
      This byte value terminates every line of zig source code except the last line of the file.
      It is recommended that non-empty source files end with an empty line, which means the last byte would be 0x0a (LF).
      

      

      Each LF may be immediately preceded by a single CR (byte value 0x0d, code point U+000d, `'\r'`)
      to form a Windows style line ending, but this is discouraged. Note that in multiline strings, CRLF sequences will
      be encoded as LF when compiled into a zig program.
      A CR in any other context is not allowed.
      

      

      HT hard tabs (byte value 0x09, code point U+0009, `'\t'`) are interchangeable with
      SP spaces (byte value 0x20, code point U+0020, `' '`) as a token separator,
      but use of hard tabs is discouraged. See [Grammar](#Grammar).
      

      

      For compatibility with other tools, the compiler ignores a UTF-8-encoded byte order mark (U+FEFF)
      if it is the first Unicode code point in the source text. A byte order mark is not allowed anywhere else in the source.
      

      

      Note that running zig fmt on a source file will implement all recommendations mentioned here.
      

      

      Note that a tool reading Zig source code can make assumptions if the source code is assumed to be correct Zig code.
      For example, when identifying the ends of lines, a tool can use a naive search such as `/\n/`,
      or an [advanced](https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/dd409797.aspx)
      search such as `/\r\n?|[\n\u0085\u2028\u2029]/`, and in either case line endings will be correctly identified.
      For another example, when identifying the whitespace before the first token on a line,
      a tool can either use a naive search such as `/[ \t]/`,
      or an [advanced](https://tc39.es/ecma262/#sec-characterclassescape) search such as `/\s/`,
      and in either case whitespace will be correctly identified.

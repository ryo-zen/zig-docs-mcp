# Zig Build System §

The Zig Build System provides a cross-platform, dependency-free way to declare the logic required to build a project. With this system, the logic to build a project is written in a build.zig file, using the Zig Build System API to declare and configure build artifacts and other tasks. 

Some examples of tasks the build system can help with: 

  * Performing tasks in parallel and caching the results.
  * Depending on other projects.
  * Providing a package for other projects to depend on.
  * Creating build artifacts by executing the Zig compiler. This includes building Zig source code as well as C and C++ source code.
  * Capturing user-configured options and using those options to configure the build.
  * Surfacing build configuration as comptime values by providing a file that can be imported by Zig code.
  * Caching build artifacts to avoid unnecessarily repeating steps.
  * Executing build artifacts or system-installed tools.
  * Running tests and verifying the output of executing a build artifact matches the expected value.
  * Running `zig fmt` on a codebase or a subset of it.
  * Custom tasks.

To use the build system, run `zig build --help` to see a command-line usage help menu. This will include project-specific options that were declared in the build.zig script.

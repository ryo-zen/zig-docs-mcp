# Style Guide §

These coding conventions are not enforced by the compiler, but they are shipped in this documentation along with the compiler in order to provide a point of reference, should anyone wish to point to an authority on agreed upon Zig coding style. 

### Avoid Redundancy in Names §

Avoid these words in type names:

  * Value
  * Data
  * Context
  * Manager
  * utils, misc, or somebody's initials

Everything is a value, all types are data, everything is context, all logic manages state. Nothing is communicated by using a word that applies to all types.

Temptation to use "utilities", "miscellaneous", or somebody's initials is a failure to categorize, or more commonly, overcategorization. Such declarations can live at the root of a module that needs them with no namespace needed.

### Avoid Redundant Names in Fully-Qualified Namespaces §

Every declaration is assigned a **fully qualified namespace** by the compiler, creating a tree structure. Choose names based on the fully-qualified namespace, and avoid redundant name segments.

redundant_fqn.zig

    ```zig
    const std = @import("std");
    
    pub const json = struct {
        pub const JsonValue = union(enum) {
            number: f64,
            boolean: bool,
            // ...
        };
    };
    
    pub fn main() void {
        std.debug.print("{s}\n", .{@typeName(json.JsonValue)});
    }
    ```

Shell

    ```
    $ zig build-exe redundant_fqn.zig
    $ ./redundant_fqn
    redundant_fqn.json.JsonValue
    
    ```

In this example, "json" is repeated in the fully-qualified namespace. The solution is to delete `Json` from `JsonValue`. In this example we have an empty struct named `json` but remember that files also act as part of the fully-qualified namespace.

This example is an exception to the rule specified in Avoid Redundancy in Names. The meaning of the type has been reduced to its core: it is a json value. The name cannot be any more specific without being incorrect.

### Whitespace §

  * 4 space indentation 
  * Open braces on same line, unless you need to wrap. 
  * If a list of things is longer than 2, put each item on its own line and exercise the ability to put an extra comma at the end. 
  * Line length: aim for 100; use common sense. 

### Names §

Roughly speaking: `camelCaseFunctionName`, `TitleCaseTypeName`, `snake_case_variable_name`. More precisely: 

  * If `x` is a `type` then `x` should be `TitleCase`, unless it is a `struct` with 0 fields and is never meant to be instantiated, in which case it is considered to be a "namespace" and uses `snake_case`. 
  * If `x` is callable, and `x`'s return type is `type`, then `x` should be `TitleCase`. 
  * If `x` is otherwise callable, then `x` should be `camelCase`. 
  * Otherwise, `x` should be `snake_case`. 

Acronyms, initialisms, proper nouns, or any other word that has capitalization rules in written English are subject to naming conventions just like any other word. Even acronyms that are only 2 letters long are subject to these conventions. 

File names fall into two categories: types and namespaces. If the file (implicitly a struct) has top level fields, it should be named like any other struct with fields using `TitleCase`. Otherwise, it should use `snake_case`. Directory names should be `snake_case`. 

These are general rules of thumb; if it makes sense to do something different, do what makes sense. For example, if there is an established convention such as `ENOENT`, follow the established convention. 

### Examples §

style_example.zig

    ```zig
    const namespace_name = @import("dir_name/file_name.zig");
    const TypeName = @import("dir_name/TypeName.zig");
    var global_var: i32 = undefined;
    const const_name = 42;
    const primitive_type_alias = f32;
    const string_alias = []u8;
    
    const StructName = struct {
        field: i32,
    };
    const StructAlias = StructName;
    
    fn functionName(param_name: TypeName) void {
        var functionPointer = functionName;
        functionPointer();
        functionPointer = otherFunction;
        functionPointer();
    }
    const functionAlias = functionName;
    
    fn ListTemplateFunction(comptime ChildType: type, comptime fixed_size: usize) type {
        return List(ChildType, fixed_size);
    }
    
    fn ShortList(comptime T: type, comptime n: usize) type {
        return struct {
            field_name: [n]T,
            fn methodName() void {}
        };
    }
    
    // The word XML loses its casing when used in Zig identifiers.
    const xml_document =
        \\<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?>
        \\<document>
        \\</document>
    ;
    const XmlParser = struct {
        field: i32,
    };
    
    // The initials BE (Big Endian) are just another word in Zig identifier names.
    fn readU32Be() u32 {}
    ```

See the Zig Standard Library for more examples. 

### Doc Comment Guidance §

  * Omit any information that is redundant based on the name of the thing being documented.
  * Duplicating information onto multiple similar functions is encouraged because it helps IDEs and other tools provide better help text.
  * Use the word **assume** to indicate invariants that cause _unchecked_ Illegal Behavior when violated.
  * Use the word **assert** to indicate invariants that cause _safety-checked_ Illegal Behavior when violated.

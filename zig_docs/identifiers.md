# Identifiers

Identifiers must start with an alphabetic character or underscore and may be followed
      by any number of alphanumeric characters or underscores.
      They must not overlap with any keywords. See [Keyword Reference](#Keyword-Reference).
      

      
## [String Identifier Syntax](#toc-String-Identifier-Syntax) §

      

      If a name that does not fit these requirements is needed, such as for
      linking with external libraries, the `@""` syntax
      may be used.

# Vectors

A vector is a group of booleans, [Integers](#Integers), [Floats](#Floats), or
[Pointers](#Pointers) which are operated on in parallel, using SIMD instructions if possible.
Vector types are created with the builtin function [@Vector](#Vector).

📚 **Runnable Examples:** `zig_docs_std/Examples/vectors.tests.zig`

Vectors generally support the same builtin operators as their underlying base types.
The only exception to this is the keywords `and` and `or` on vectors of bools, since
these operators affect control flow, which is not allowed for vectors.
All other operations are performed element-wise, and return a vector of the same length
as the input vectors. This includes:

    Arithmetic (`+`, `-`, `/`, `*`,
                   `@divFloor`, `@sqrt`, `@ceil`,
                   `@log`, etc.)
    Bitwise operators (`>>`, `<<`, `&`,
                           `|`, `~`, etc.)

- Comparison operators (`<`, `>`, `==`, etc.)

- Boolean not (`!`)

It is prohibited to use a math operator on a mixture of scalars (individual numbers)
and vectors. Zig provides the [@splat](#splat) builtin to easily convert from scalars
to vectors, and it supports [@reduce](#reduce) and array indexing syntax to convert
from vectors to scalars. Vectors also support assignment to and from fixed-length
arrays with comptime-known length.

For rearranging elements within and between vectors, Zig provides the [@shuffle](#shuffle) and [@select](#select) functions.

Operations on vectors shorter than the target machine's native SIMD size will typically compile to single SIMD
instructions, while vectors longer than the target machine's native SIMD size will compile to multiple SIMD
instructions. If a given operation doesn't have SIMD support on the target architecture, the compiler will default
to operating on each vector element one at a time. Zig supports any comptime-known vector length up to 2^32-1,
although small powers of two (2-64) are most typical. Note that excessively long vector lengths (e.g. 2^20) may
result in compiler crashes on current versions of Zig.

test_vector.zig
```zig
const std = @import("std");
const expectEqual = std.testing.expectEqual;

test "Basic vector usage" {
    // Vectors have a compile-time known length and base type.
    const a = @Vector(4, i32){ 1, 2, 3, 4 };
    const b = @Vector(4, i32){ 5, 6, 7, 8 };

    // Math operations take place element-wise.
    const c = a + b;

    // Individual vector elements can be accessed using array indexing syntax.
    try expectEqual(6, c[0]);
    try expectEqual(8, c[1]);
    try expectEqual(10, c[2]);
    try expectEqual(12, c[3]);
}

test "Conversion between vectors, arrays, and slices" {
    // Vectors can be coerced to arrays, and vice versa.
    const arr1: [4]f32 = [_]f32{ 1.1, 3.2, 4.5, 5.6 };
    const vec: @Vector(4, f32) = arr1;
    const arr2: [4]f32 = vec;
    try expectEqual(arr1, arr2);

    // You can also assign from a slice with comptime-known length to a vector using .*
    const vec2: @Vector(2, f32) = arr1[1..3].*;

    const slice: []const f32 = &arr1;
    var offset: u32 = 1; // var to make it runtime-known
    _ = &offset; // suppress 'var is never mutated' error
    // To extract a comptime-known length from a runtime-known offset,
    // first extract a new slice from the starting offset, then an array of
    // comptime-known length
    const vec3: @Vector(2, f32) = slice[offset..][0..2].*;
    try expectEqual(slice[offset], vec2[0]);
    try expectEqual(slice[offset + 1], vec2[1]);
    try expectEqual(vec2, vec3);
}

## [Relationship with Arrays](#toc-Relationship-with-Arrays) §

Vectors and [Arrays](#Arrays) each have a well-defined **bit layout**
and therefore support [@bitCast](#bitCast) between each other. [Type Coercion](#Type-Coercion) implicitly performs
`@bitCast`.

Arrays have well-defined byte layout, but vectors do not, making [@ptrCast](#ptrCast) between
them [Illegal Behavior](#Illegal-Behavior).

## [Destructuring Vectors](#toc-Destructuring-Vectors) §

  Vectors can be destructured:

destructuring_vectors.zig
```zig
const print = @import("std").debug.print;

// emulate punpckldq
pub fn unpack(x: @Vector(4, f32), y: @Vector(4, f32)) @Vector(4, f32) {
    const a, const c, _, _ = x;
    const b, const d, _, _ = y;
    return .{ a, b, c, d };
}

pub fn main() void {
    const x: @Vector(4, f32) = .{ 1.0, 2.0, 3.0, 4.0 };
    const y: @Vector(4, f32) = .{ 5.0, 6.0, 7.0, 8.0 };
    print("{}", .{unpack(x, y)});
}
```
Shell$ zig build-exe destructuring_vectors.zig
$ ./destructuring_vectors
